        <p>I am Edward and this is my space. I am an aspiring full stack developer in the making. I like bringing ideas into unique and great looking webpages and apps that are going to change how things are in our society. </p>
        <p>
            My dream is to  collaborate with others to create great appications that are going to impact my society and modernise how things are being handled in my society today.</p>

        <p>Python is one of my favourite languages. It is in fact my favourite because it was the first language that introduced me to programming. Over the oast year I have been inroduced to concepts such as functions, conditional statements, varibales and data structures to list the few. I have had to pause on it because of school - in school we were introduced to newer languages so to avoid conflicting I had to pause a bit
            <p>Java is an interesting language of which I hope to look into  in the future. I have learnt it in school together with C and C++ and what I like about it is the number if libraries it has a support for and you can literally create anything with Java from programs to linking databases and even mobile apps! </p>

                <p>html, css and javascript:  These are my recent languages that I have dived into and they are pretty amazing. Since I will be working with frameworks like Django and Node Js I thougt it would be wise to delve into Javascript early </p>
                <h2>Html,CSS and Javascript</h2><center><img src="html,css,js.png" alt="html, css and javascript" height="150px" width="250px" ></center>
                <p>Since it has been a year since beginning serious coding, I have been able to achieve so little because I had to learn the basics of programming but I expect over the course of this year and the most of next year I will be able to write complex programs on Python, html, css and Javascript</p></p>
