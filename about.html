    <p>I aspire to be a backend developer and I pursued Information Technology because of it's diversified approach in the technological space. It explores a wide area of topics from software developing to cyber security, databases, networking to ethics and communication skills not to mention the number of careers I can dive into in each of the field mentioned. My favourite part about the course is, as you guessed it, Programming. With Programming, you get to speak your mind out through code and make art through it as well. From simple web designs such as this to complex applications that process millions of users data every second such as Twittter and Amazon.It is indeed an interesting world to dive into.</p>

    <p>Writing code on it's own brings me great pleasure and happiness, seeing how you can transform your imagination to something totally unique and impressive to look at is always a dream come true Writing code Inspires me to be what I dream of becoming. </p>
    <p>I am currently learning various programming languages to gain the fluency and experience to make use of them in the future. Below are some of the languages I have been able to learn and I am in the process of polishing on them.</p>
